    <ol>
        <li>To make the dipping sauce: Combine soy sauce, rice vinegar, chives, sesame seeds, and chile-garlic sauce in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Place a dumpling wrapper on a lightly floured work surface and spoon about 1 tablespoon of filling in the middle.</li>
        <li>Wet the edge with a little water and crimp together forming small pleats to seal the dumpling. Repeat to form remaining dumplings.</li>
