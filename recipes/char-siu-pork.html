    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This Chinese barbeque pork is glossy, deliciously savory, and quite easy to make at home â€” even without a fancy ceramic grill.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Serves 6</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Chinese rice wine</li>
        <li>1/3 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1.3 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pink curing salt</li>
        <li>3 pounds boneless pork shoulder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place soy sauce, honey, rice wine, hoisin sauce, ketchup, brown sugar, garlic, five-spice powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and curing salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil on high heat; reduce heat to medium-high. Cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Cut pork in half lengthwise. Cut each half again lengthwise forming 4 long, thick pieces of pork.</li>
        <li>Transfer cooled sauce to a large mixing bowl. Stir in red food coloring. Place pork sections into sauce and coat each piece. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate 4 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for medium heat, 275 to 300 degrees F (135 to 150 degrees C) and lightly oil the grate. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Remove sections of pork from marinade and let excess drip off. Place on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer pork sections to grate over indirect heat on the prepared grill. Cover and cook for about 45 minutes. Brush with marinade; turn. Continue cooking until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes more. Do not use any more marinade on cooked meat until after you boil it.</li>
        <li>Place leftover marinade in a saucepan; bring to a boil; let simmer for 1 minute. Remove from heat. Now you can use it to brush over the cooked pork.</li>
    </ol>
